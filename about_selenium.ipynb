    "Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. Here's how to get started with Selenium WebDriver in Python.\n",

    "Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the Selenium package using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install selenium\n",
    "Copier\n",
    "Example: Opening a Website\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to open a website using Selenium WebDriver:\n",
    "\n",
    "from selenium import webdriver\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Firefox driver\n",
    "driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a website\n",
    "driver.get(\"http://www.example.com\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the title of the page\n",
    "print(driver.title)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the browser\n",

    "# Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Drivers: Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. For Firefox, you need geckodriver, and for Chrome, you need chromedriver. Ensure these drivers are installed and added to your system PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browser Compatibility: Selenium supports multiple browsers like Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge. Make sure to download the appropriate driver for the browser you intend to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Mode: For running tests without opening a browser window, you can use headless mode. This is useful for running scripts in environments without a graphical interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can start automating web tasks using Selenium WebDriver in Python efficiently\n"
